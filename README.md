# RAG System for Corpus Generation and Article Retrieval

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of generating a corpus and retrieving relevant articles based on user queries or prompts. The system combines the power of language models for text generation with efficient retrieval mechanisms to provide accurate and contextually relevant information.

## Features

- **Corpus Generation**: Automatically generates a corpus of articles or documents using a pre-trained language model.
- **Query-Based Retrieval**: Retrieves the most relevant article from the generated corpus based on a user query or prompt.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of the corpus size, topic, and retrieval parameters.
- **Efficient Search**: Utilizes advanced retrieval techniques (e.g., vector search, TF-IDF, or BM25) for fast and accurate article retrieval.

## How It Works

1. **Corpus Generation**:
   - The system uses a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT, BERT) to generate a corpus of articles on a specified topic or domain.
   - Users can define the size of the corpus and the type of content to be generated.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - When a user submits a query or prompt, the system processes it to extract key terms and context.

3. **Article Retrieval**:
   - The system searches the generated corpus using retrieval algorithms (e.g., vector similarity, keyword matching) to find the most relevant article.
   - The retrieved article is then presented to the user.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-system.git
   cd rag-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download pre-trained models (if needed):
   ```bash
   python download_models.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Generate a corpus:
   ```python
   from rag_system import generate_corpus

   corpus = generate_corpus(topic="Artificial Intelligence", num_articles=100)
   ```

2. Retrieve an article based on a query:
   ```python
   from rag_system import retrieve_article

   query = "What are the latest advancements in AI?"
   article = retrieve_article(corpus, query)
   print(article)
   ```

## Configuration

- Modify `config.yaml` to customize the corpus generation and retrieval settings.
- Adjust the retrieval algorithm parameters for better performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Transformers library (for language models)
- FAISS or Elasticsearch (for efficient retrieval)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
